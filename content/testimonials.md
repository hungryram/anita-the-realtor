testimonial = "My fiancé and I were starting to look into purchasing our first home early in the year. With the amount of information out there (and lack of) we found it to be particularly overwhelming. Fortunately for us, we had Anita. Not only did she show us kindness, but she showed us patience. Anita was available for us any time of the day—and as servers, our hours can be odd. She made time for us whenever we needed it. She went above and beyond to go out of her own city and show us properties around Orange and Riverside counties. She always has an abundance of listings to comb through, targeting them to exactly what we were looking for. Anita gives valuable advice—not just logical choices from the experience she has, but also from-the-heart words. She wasn’t just selling us something, she was making sure we found a special place to build our lives and family. I can tell she is personally invested in her clients. I could not recommend Anita ENOUGH!! She will make your home buying experience as painless as it can be, and she’ll hold your hand through the many, many questions that come up without making you feel silly! I would absolutely choose Anita to help us with a home purchase again. Her wisdom, experience and most of all KINDNESS really sets her above the rest. Thank you so much Anita!! You’re the best of the best!!"
